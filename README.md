# Pokemon-ASCII-Art
Just a fun PS script that turns a pokemon into ASCII art


## Directions 

Takes two parameters:

```
  $spritePosition
```
and

```
  $pokemon
```

Sprite Position can only have the following values:
'back_default', 'back_female', 'back_shiny', 'back_shiny_female', 'front_default', 'front_female', 'front_shiny', 'front_shiny_female'

Should take any valid pokemon that Pokeapi.co has on it.
Not every pokemon has every sprite.

# WIP!!!
Cannot stress this enough. This is still being worked on and is mostly just for fun.
